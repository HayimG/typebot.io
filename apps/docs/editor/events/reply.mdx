This event will trigger everytime a reply is received, meaning whenever a user replies to any input in the flow. This is triggered even before the reply is processed and validated. This is useful when you need to execute a specific flow / automation whenever the user replies to the bot.

## Exit condition

By default, the flow will continue where it left off after the Reply Event sub-flow ends. You can add an **Exit condition** to end the chat session at the end of the Reply Event flow. For example, you can decide to end the conversation whenever the user replies "exit".

## Example use cases

- Automatically end the session if the user replies with "end", "exit", "quit".
- Automatically trigger a feedback collection flow whenever a user replies with specific keywords like "feedback" "suggestion" or "comment".
