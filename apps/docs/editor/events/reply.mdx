title: Reply Event
---

This event will trigger everytime a reply is received, meaning whenever a user replies to any input in the flow. This is useful when you need to execute a specific flow / automation whenever the user replies to the bot.

## Exit condition

By default, the flow will continue where it left off after the Reply Event sub-flow ends. You can add an **Exit condition** to exit the bot at the end of the Reply Event block flow. For example, you can decide to end the conversation whenever the user replies "exit".
